# Soundflix
Creating a platform similar to the Netflix website but using only the anime soundtracks.

This project was created based on DIO (Digital Innovation One) classes but I added more features such as: increasing the image size when the cursor is on top of it and redirecting the image to a specific link.

Here are some of demonstrations that will show you a little bit of the project
